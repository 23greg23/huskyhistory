<h1>The first king</h1>
<h2>King Husky I</h2>
<p class="one">For the first 30 years of existence, Northeastern University had no mascot. Sports teams and the student body were referred to simply as [Northeasterners]. In 1925, in an effort to boost school spirit, it was felt that the adoption of a school mascot could be in order and a search committee was formed. Animal mascots were in vogue during the 1920s and, coincidently, the news story that gripped the nation that year was the rush delivery of an diphtheria antitoxin serum by dog sled across uncharted Alaska. Several sled teams covered 674 miles in 5½ days to deliver the live-saving vaccine, thus saving Nome, Alaska and the surrounding isolated communities from an impending epidemic.</p>
Intrigued, Northeastern’s then Vice-President, Carl Ell, contacted one of the Alaskan serum run’s lead mushers, Leonhard Seppala,a Norwegian sled dog breeder and trainer then living in New England,On March 4, 1927, a husky named Sapsut, whose father had been on Seppala’s team during the Alaska run, was delivered to the university. Known as King Husky I, Sapsut began his reign as Northeastern’s first official mascot.

Then Northeastern president Frank Speare cancelled classes on the day of his arrival and presented the new mascot in a University-wide celebration. Northeastern now had its own personal Balto.

King Husky I served for 14 years as mascot and died of old age in 1941. He was briefly replaced by another Seppala husky, Queen Husky I, who reigned for just a few months.

<h1>A stable reign</h1>
<h2>King Husky II</h2>
<p class="one">In 1942, at the recommendation of Leonard Seppala, Northeastern began a 16 year relationship with Chinook Kennels in Wonalancet, New Hampshire. Kennel director Eva Seely gifted the university’s second official mascot, King Husky II, who came from a long line of sled and exploration dogs. Several of Seeley’s dogs served in the Antarctic with the famous explorer Admiral Richard Byrd. King Husky II served as Northeastern’s mascot for 10 years until he retired in 1952.</p>

<h1>Tumult and tragedy</h1>
<h2>King Husky III, Princess Regent Husky I, and King Husky IV</h2>
<p class="one">The abdication of King Husky II in 1952 ushered in a period of uncertainty and turbulence in the royal lineage. Successor King Husky III,  also bred at Chinook Kennels, contracted a mysterious illness in June of 1955 and was euthanized.</p>

Northeastern kept the news of the dog’s death a secret until September 1955. Shocked and outraged, the student newspaper, The Northeastern News, planned an expose of the perceived administrative cover-up. When the school intervened, four student editors quit amid accusations of censorship. To quell the controversy, a temporary mascot was deemed necessary and Princess Regent Husky I— also bred and trained by Seeley—was crowned in September 1955 until spring of 1957.

King Husky IV, was crowned in February of 1958. In the summer of 1958 an outbreak of distemper, ​​a highly contagious viral disease tore through Chinook Kennels killing all resident dogs, including King Husky IV.
From 1958 to 1960, the University named King Husky IV's father, Alyeskas Suggen, as a temporary mascot for sporting events.

<h1>Interregnum</h1>
<p class="one">In 1960, Northeastern suspended the live mascot program following the turbulence of the previous decade. Instead, “Mr. Husky” was born. Set up as an election-style competition, one male student was awarded the title and would wear a husky suit to sporting events. Later in the 1960s, Mrs. Husky was introduced, becoming an official co-mascot.</p>
Intending to help fill the void left by the discontinuation of the live mascot tradition, the Husky Statue Fund Drive began in 1959 to raise funds for a statue depicting the beloved King Husky I. Sculpted by Adio di Biccari and Arcangelo Cascieri, the statue was completed and installed in 1962 in Ell Hall, where it remains to this day. Tradition holds that rubbing the husky’s nose will bring you good luck in the coming academic year and the bronze statue's nose shows distinct signs of wear from hopeful students over the years.

<h2>King Husky V</h2>
<p class="one">In 1965, the graduating class of 1970 decided to raise funds to buy a new canine mascot for the school with the stipulation that the dog would “graduate” with the class. King Husky V served as live mascot for five years until the class of 1970 graduated. He then returned to his original breeder.</p>

<h1>A dark throne</h1>
<h2>Queen Husky II &amp; King Husky VI</h2>
<p class="one">After the departure of King Husky V, The Husky Key Society—a student activities group at the time—crowned Queen Husky II and put her in the care of one of their members. The Queen did not have the temperament for royalty and thus was unable to continue in her duties. Her son, King Husky VI then ascended to the throne in September 1972 and was a popular and well-liked mascot.</p>
In November 1972, the young king escaped from his kennel in Newton, Massachusetts and was struck by a car. He was seriously injured in the accident, and had to be euthanized three days later.

<h1>The longest reign</h1>
<h2>King Husky VII and Paws</h2>
<p class="one">The longest serving mascot was also the University’s last for fifteen years. Taking over after the untimely death of King Husky VI, King Husky VII reigned peacefully from 1972 until his death from old age in 1989.</p>
Reluctance to continue with the risks involved with the live mascot program, combined with difficulty in locating a suitable replacement, forced the University to suspend the program for a second time since 1927. For the next 15 years, there would be no live mascot, and Mr. and Mrs. Husky would keep the Husky spirit alive at sporting events and other functions.

In the fall of 2003, Northeastern unveiled Paws—a new, updated, costumed mascot designed to replace the student-elected Mr. and Mrs. Husky with a dedicated, more athletic, and charismatic mascot who would apply and try-out for the role. Paws proved to be a fun and popular character and maintains an active appearance schedule as well as a lively social media presence to this day.

<h1>A new beginning</h1>
<p class="one">In 2005, Northeastern looked to return to its tradition of having a live, purebred Husky mascot. Alumna <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2017/10/11/meet-the-alumna-who-raises-northeasterns-king-husky-mascot/">Margaret Cook</a>— a 1964 graduate of the university’s liberal arts program and breeder of Siberian Huskies at Teeco Kennels in Easton, MA—answered the call. Three of Cook’s huskies have worn the crown since 2005,with the first being a direct descendant of Sapsut. The current King Husky (often with a retinue of puppies and canine cohorts in tow) frequently makes appearances on campus and each royal visit is truly an event with students lining up to visit and take selfies with the King.</p>
