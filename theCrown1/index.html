      <h2>King Husky <span class="noScript">I</span></h2>
      <p>For the first 30 years of our existence, Northeastern had no mascot. Our sports teams and student body were referred to simply as  [Northeasterners]. In 1925, in an effort to boost school spirit, it was felt that the adoption of a mascot could be in order and a search committee was formed. Coincidently, the news story that gripped the nation that year was the rush delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin serum by dog sled across uncharted Alaska. Several teams covered 674 miles in 5½ days, thus saving Nome and the surrounding isolated communities from an impending epidemic. Huskies were suddenly the “it” dog of the Roaring 20s! </p>
        <p>  Northeastern’s Vice-President, Carl Ell, contacted one of the Alaskan serum run’s mushers, Leonhard Seppala— a Norwegian sled dog breeder and trainer then living in New England—and on March 4, 1927, King Husky I arrived at Northeastern. His real name was Sapsut and his father had been on Seppala’s team during the Alaska run.</p>
            <p>President Frank Speare cancelled classes for the day and presented the new mascot to the students in a University-wide celebration featuring speeches, bands, and parades.</p>
                <p>King Husky served 14 years as mascot and died of old age in 1941. He was briefly replaced by another Seppala husky, Queen Husky I, who reigned for just a few months.  </p>

      <p>In 1942, Northeastern began a 16 year relationship with Chinook Kennels in Wonalancet, New Hampshire under the direction of Eva Seeley. King Husky II came from a long line of sled and exploration dogs (several of Seeley’s dogs had served in the Antarctic with Admiral Richard Byrd) and was Northeastern’s mascot for 10 years finally retiring in 1952.</p>

      <h2>King Husky <span class="noScript">III</span>, Princess Regent Husky <span class="noScript">I</span>, and King Husky <span class="noScript">IV</span></h2>
      <p>The abdication of King Husky II in 1952 ushered in a period of uncertainty and turbulence in the King Husky lineage. King Husky II was succeeded by King Husky III—the second Northeastern mascot to be bred at Chinook Kennels—but he fell ill and had to be euthanized in June of 1955.</p>
      <p>The University, however, kept the news of the king’s death a secret until the beginning of the academic year in September.  This provoked outrage in the student body with student newspaper, The Northeastern News, planning an expose of the perceived cover-up. When school administrators stepped in to kill the story, four editors quit amid accusations of censorship. To quell the controversy, a temporary mascot was deemed necessary and Princess Regent Husky I— also bred and trained by Seeley—was brought in from September 1955 until spring of 1957.</p>
      <p> A new king—King Husky IV—was eventually crowned in February of 1958. However, tragedy soon befell the House of Husky once again as an outbreak of distemper tore through Chinook Kennels in August killing many dogs including the young mascot.</p>
      <p>For the remainder of 1958 through 1960, the University brought in King Husky IV's father, Alyeskas Suggen, as a temporary mascot for sporting events.</p>

      <h1><span class="firstLetter">I</span>nterregnum </h1>
      <p>After such an unsettled decade, Northeastern decided to suspend the live mascot program and develop some new traditions. “Mr. Husky”—a precursor to Paws—was a competition that awarded the title to a male student that would wear a husky suit to University sporting events. Later in the 1960s, Mr. Husky took a bride and Mrs. Husky became an official co-mascot with Mr. Husky.</p>
      <p>Intending to help fill the void left by the discontinuation of the live mascot tradition, in 1959 the Husky Statue Fund Drive began to raise funds for a statue depicting King Husky I. Sculpted by Adio di Biccari and Arcangelo Cascieri, the statue was completed and installed in 1962 and stands in Ell Hall to this day. Tradition holds that rubbing the husky’s nose will bring you good luck in the coming academic year and the bronze statue's nose shows distinct signs of wear from hopeful students over the years.</p>

        <h2>King Husky <span class="noScript">V</span></h2>
      <p>In 1965, the graduating class of 1970 decided to take matters into their own hands and raised funds to buy a new canine mascot for the school with the stipulation that the dog would “graduate” with the class. King Husky V served as mascot throughout the swinging 60s until the class of 1970 graduated when he then returned to his original breeder.</p>

        <h2>Queen Husky <span class="noScript">II</span> & King Husky <span class="noScript">VI</span></h2>
      <p>After the departure of King Husky V, The Husky Key Society—a student activities group at the time—crowned Queen Husky II and put her in the care of one of their members. The Queen did not have the temperament for rule and suffered from crippling stagefright and thus was unable to continue her duties. Her son, King Husky VI ascended to the throne in September 1972 and was a popular and well-liked mascot.</p>

<p>Tragedy struck the Huskies again in November 1972 when King Husky VI escaped from his kennel in Newton, Massachusetts and was struck by a car.  He was seriously injured in the accident, and he had to be euthenized three days later.</p>

        <h2>King Husky <span class="noScript">VI</span> and Paws</h2>
      <p>The longest serving mascot was also the University’s last—for a while. Taking over after the untimely death of King Husky VI, King Husky VII reigned peacefully for 16 years from 1972 until his death from old age in 1989. Difficulty in finding a replacement combined with reluctance by some to risk the uncertainty of keeping a live mascot forced the University to suspend the program for the second time since 1927. For the next 15 years, there would be no live mascot and Mr. and Mrs. Husky would dutifully keep the Husky spirit alive at sporting events and other University functions.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2003, Northeastern unveiled Paws—a new, updated, costumed mascot designed to replace the student-elected Mr. and Mrs. Husky with a more athletic and charismatic mascot who would apply and try-out for the role. Paws proved to be a fun and popular character and maintains an active appearance schedule as well as a lively social media presence.</p>

      <p>In 2005, Northeastern looked to return to its tradition of having a live, purebred Husky mascot. Alumna Margaret Cook— a 1964 graduate of the university’s language arts program and breeder of Siberian Huskies at Teeco Kennels—answered the call. Three of Cook’s Teeco Huskies have worn the crown since 2005 with the first being a direct descendant of Sapsut and crowned King Husky VIII.</p>
      <p> The current King Husky (often with a retinue of puppies and canine cohorts in tow) frequently makes appearances on campus and each royal visit is truly an event with students lining up to visit and take selfies with the King.</p>
